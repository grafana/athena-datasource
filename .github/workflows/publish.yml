      # Scope for the plugin published to the catalog. Setting this to "grafana_cloud" will make it visible only in Grafana Cloud
      # (and hide it for on-prem). This is required for some provisioned plugins.

      # Also deploy the plugin to Grafana Cloud via Argo. You also have to follow the Argo Workflows setup guide for this to work.
